# SLoPe: Double-Pruned Sparse Plus Lazy Low-rank Adapter Pretraining

SLoPe is a novel approach for efficient and accurate large language model pretraining. Our method leverages double-pruned sparse plus lazy low-rank adapters to achieve remarkable speedups and memory reductions.

## Code Coming Soon!
We are excited to share our code with the community and are working on preparing it for release. Please stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your patience!

## About SLoPe
SLoPe is a research project that aims to push the boundaries of efficient large language model pretraining. Our approach has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in various benchmarks, and we believe it has the potential to benefit a wide range of natural language processing applications.
